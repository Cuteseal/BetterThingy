A Youtuber by the name of "The Mysticle" made a Zombie wave game for VR, What I want to do is re-make that game for non-VR and improve on some mechanics and optimisation



<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a fall back branch, just in case shit goes haywire
=======
                          What I plan to add is some sort of combat (like grenades and melee) and zombies that can attack you
                      this is my first attempt at an actual game and not just a protoype so I hope you like it when it's available
